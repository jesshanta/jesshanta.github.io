			<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;"> About Me </h1>
			<p>I'm currently in my 4th year of Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am not your stereotypical Software Engineer. I have the same drive to figure out problems as most engineers do and I get the thrill of finally getting your program to work. However, I am a minority in the tech field and I have felt the consequences of that. For this reason, I am incredibly passionate about decreasing the gender gap in the tech field. It is important for girls to be encouraged to program from a young age so they can hopefully reach their full potential and not quit when they see they are one of the few women. I am heavily involved in outreach programs at the University of Waterloo to spark the coding interest in young girls. Diversity is important, and I want to be part of the change. </p>

			<p>I love coding and technology. I want to make a difference in the world, and I am fortunate to be in a field where that's actually possible. I am interested in researching alternative medical imaging solutions so people don't have to be waitlisted to see if something is wrong with them. I think it's important for Software to be accessible to as many people as possible, so designing User Interfaces that most people can figure out intuitively is another passion of mine. My passions are not limited and I am a highly motivated and determined person, and I like solving any problems that come my way. </p>
